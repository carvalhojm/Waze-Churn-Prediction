# CONCLUSION:

# - Almost all variables were either very skewed to the right or evenly distributed.
# - Several variables had highly unlikely or perhaps even impossible outliers, such 
# as `km_driven_driven`. Some of the monthly variables may also be problematic, such 
# as `activity_days` and `driving_days`, because one has a maximum value of 31, while 
# the other has a maximum value of 30.
# - Further investigation would be necessary to determine why so many long-term users 
# started using the app so frequently only in the last month. Were there any changes 
# in the last month that might have motivated this type of behavior?
# - Less than 18% of users churned, and ~82% were retained.
# - Distance driven per driving day had a positive correlation with user churn. The 
# farther a user drove on each driving day, the more likely they were to churn. On 
# the other hand, number of driving days had a negative correlation with churn. Users 
# who drove more days of the last month were less likely to churn.
# - Users of all tenures from brand new to ~10 years were relatively evenly represented 
# in the data.
